      <summary>What is OpenAI used for?</summary>
      <p>
        OpenAI was originally focused on developing AI and machine learning
        tools for video games and other recreational purposes. Less than a year
        after its official founding on December 11, 2015, it released its first
        AI offering, an open source toolkit for developing reinforcement
        learning (RI) algorithms called OpenAI Gym.

      <summary>Can I use OpenAI for free?</summary>
      <p>
        OpenAI Playground is free to use, but it comes with a time limit of
        approximately 3 to 4 months. When you sign up for an account on OpenAI,
        you receive an initial credit of $18, which allows the AI to generate
        around 650,000 words for you.
